# 1.3.3
Fixes to readAsync, cancelAsync should work now

# 1.3.2
Extra examples, some ease of use stuff

# 1.3.1
readAsync works, but cancelAsync does not

this means that if you want to use asynchronous operations they are unstoppable (I have no clue why it does not work)

# 1.3.0
Update packages, simple fixes (prepare for async)
